# Spotify Lite Rebuild

## Original Site
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)

## Project Description
This is a “lite” React rebuild of Spotify, focusing on the initial layout and core components.  
It includes a header, search bar, and playlist cards with placeholder content.  
The goal is to practice translating a real website’s structure into a component-based React application.

## Run Locally
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
